To view the notes properly, you need to  have a sufficient python installation and use jupyter. Running online is no longer permitted due to copyright issues.

Individual notebooks (files with the extension ``ipynb``) can be run *within* the virtual machine created with one of the two links in the sentences right above this.

See [Getting Started](https://github.com/josephcslater/Tennessee_Tech_ECE_3210/blob/master/Getting_Started.rst) for step-by-step instructions on getting the notes running on your personal computer. 

<!--- If you click on the names outside of the virtual machine, you can't run any of the demos, you can just read them!!! --->

If you wish to learn how to install Scientific Python on your own computer, please see my [introductory class readme](https://github.com/josephcslater/Introduction_to_Python/blob/master/README.rst).

If you wish to *edit* these notes and send me corrections (you would learn a lot doing this), you need to **fork** the repository, and clone from your own account. You can then edit on your computer, commit the back to your repository then submit a pull request in your repository. I'll review and approve or deny your changes. Good practice is to just try with a single typo correction (it can't be hard to find them!).
